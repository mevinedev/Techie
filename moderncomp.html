        <div> computer hardware 
            <p>  Ports are connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer.</p> <br>
            <p>  CPU as the brain of our computer. The CPU does all the calculations and data processing. It communicates pretty heavily with Random Access Memory.</p> <br>
            <p> Ram is our computer's short-term memory. We use this component when we want to store data temporarily.</p> <br>
            <p>  The hard drive holds all our data, which can include music, pictures, applications. </p> <br>
            <p> motherboard holds everything in place and let's our components communicate with each other. </p> <br>
            <p> power supply converts the electricity from our wall outlet onto a format that our computer can use</p>
        </div>
     
      <div> 
            <p> overclocking - exceeding the number of clock cycles on a CPU order to perform more tasks. 
                This is commonly used to increase the performance in low-end CPUs 
            EDB is a row of wires that interconnect the parts of our computer, kind of like the veins in our body. 
            The MCC sends data grabbed from the RAM and sends it to the CPU through the EDB.
        Random Access Memory (RAM) stores data temporarily. Registers store the data that the CPU works with.
    </p>



</div>
   <div> <h2> CPU </h2>
    <p> instruction set - which is a list of instructions that our CPU is able to run. 
        Instruction sets are hard-coded into our CPU so different CPU manufacturers may use different instruction sets, but they generally perform the same functions. 
        popular CPU manufacturers or chipsets, like Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm. These CPU manufacturers use different product names to differentiate their processes. 
        Like Intel Core i7, AMD Athlon, Snapdragon 810, Apple A8, and more.
        When you select your CPU, you need to make sure it's compatible with your motherboard.
        Your CPU might have lots of tiny pins that are either stick out or have contact points that look like dots. 
        Depending on your motherboard, you need to make sure these CPUs fit correctly in the socket. 
        There are currently two major types of CPU sockets; Land Grid Array, also known as LGA, and Pin Grid Array, also known as PGA. 
        In an LGA socket there are pins that stick out of the motherboard. The socket size may vary, so always make sure your CPU and socket are compatible beforehand. 
        the PGA socket, where the pins are located on the processor itself. When we installed our CPU, we need to do a few things to it to keep it cool.
        Since it does a lot of work, it's prone to overheating. We have to make sure to include a heat sink too which takes the heat from our CPU and dissipates it through a fan or another medium.
        CPUs that have 32-bit or 64-bit architecture are just specifying how much data they can efficiently handle
    </p>

</div>
<div> <h2> RAM </h2>
    <p> RAM is our computers short-term memory. We use RAM to store data that we want to access quickly. This data changes all the time so it isn't permanent. 
        Almost all RAM is volatile, which means that once we power off our machines, the data stored in RAM is cleared.
        To run a program, we need to make a copy of it in RAM so our CPU can process it.
        An example of RAM is dynamic random-access memory, it stores each bit in a microscopic capacitor, this is either charged or discharged, represented by 1 or a 0. These semiconductors are put into chips that are on the RAM and store our data.
        Just like with the CPU, make sure that your motherboard is compatible with any RAM sticks that you buy

    </p>

</div>
<div> <h2> motherboards </h2>
    <p> 
        key components of a motherboard: <br>
        chipset - decides how components talk to each other on our machine. The chipset on motherboards is made up of two chips. 
        One is called the Northbridge that interconnects stuff like RAM and video cards. The other chip is the Southbridge, which maintains our input-output controllers, like hard drives and USB devices, that input and output data.
        <br>
        The chipset is a key component of our motherboard that allows us to manage data between our CPU, RAM, and peripherals.
        <br>
        Peripherals are the external devices we connect to our computer, like a mouse, keyboard, and the monitor.
        <br> 
        Expansion slots also give us the ability to increase the functionality of our computer. If you wanted to upgrade your graphics card, you could purchase one and just install it on your motherboard through the expansion slot.
        <br>
        form factor- There are different size of motherboards that are available today. These sizes of form factors determine the amount of stuff we can put in it and the amount of space we'll have.
        <br>
        
        

    </p>

</div>
<div> 
    <h2> Physical storage : Hard drives</h2>
    <p> 
        A bit can store one binary digit,
        byte is comprised of eight bits
         A kilobyte is made up of 1,024 bytes.
         There are two basic hard drive types used today. Hard describes or HDDs uses a spinning platter and a mechanical arm to read and write information. The speed that the platter rotate allows you to read and write data faster. This is commonly referred to as RPM or revolution per minute. 
          A hard drive with a higher RPM is faster.
         HDDs are prone to a lot more damage because there are a lot of moving parts, but they are more affodable.<br>
         This susceptibility to damage went away with a new type of storage called solid state drive or SSD. 
         SSDs have no moving parts. Are you familiar with a USB stick? SSDs operate in a similar way. The information is stored on microchips and data travels a lot faster than HDDs. The form factor for SSDs is also slimmer compared to HDD. <br>


    </p>
    <p> 
         There are a few interfaces that hard drives use to connect our system. ATA interfaces are the most common ones. The most popular ATA drive is a Serial ATA or SATA, which uses one cable for data transfers. 
         SATA drives are hot swappable, great term, don't you think? It means you don't have to turn off your machine to plug in a SATA drive. SATA drives move data faster and use a more efficient cable.
         The interface couldn't keep up with the speeds of the newest SSDs. <br>
         So another interface standard was created called NVM express, or NVMe.
         Instead of using a cable to connect your drive to your machine, the drive was added as an expansion slot, which allows for greater throughput of data and increased efficiency.
          <br>

    </p>

</div>
        
<div> <h2> Power supply</h2>
    <p>
        Our computers use DC voltage so we have to have a way to convert the AC voltage from our power company to something we can use. That's what our power supply does. 
        most power supply units have a fan, voltage information which is normally listed underneath or on the side, and cables like this one to power your motherboard and a power cable.
        When selecting a power supply for a computer, the following items should be taken into consideration:
        Wall socket input voltage standard for the country where the computer will be used;
        The number and power consumption needs of the computer’s internal components;
        The motherboard model and form factor engineering specifications and requirements.
<br>
    </p>
</div>
        
<div> <h2> Mobile devices</h2>
<p>
    Mobile devices are computers too, they have CPUs, RAM, storage, power systems and peripherals. They are special because they are mobile.
    They're portable and usually powered by batteries. Some mobile devices are general purpose computing devices, like tablets or smartphones. 
    Other mobile devices are optimized to perform a specific set of tasks, like fitness monitors, e-readers, and smartwatches. Mobile devices are usually very integrated.
</p>
    <P>
        A charge cycle is one full charge and discharge of a battery. IT support specialist often have to troubleshoot battery life and device charging. 
        The first step is to make sure the charger, the battery and the device are all designed to work with each other.
    </P>
    </div> 
    <DIV> <h2> peripherals </h2>
    <p>
        A peripheral is basically anything that you connect your computer externally that adds functionality. 
        You've probably used USB devices before. USB, also known as universal serial bus devices, are the most popular connections for our gadgets.
        The ports are easy to differentiate, let me show you. In general, USB 2.0 are black with 480 Mbps transfer speed, and USB 3.0 are blue 5Gbps transfer speed and 3.1 ports  10 Gbps transfer speed are teal.
        The most recent one is a Type C connector, which is meant to replace many peripheral connections. In addition to audio and video, USB Type C can also do data transfer and power.
        It's quickly becoming a universal standard for display and data transfer. 
        In addition to USB peripherals, you should also be aware of display peripherals.
    </p>
    <p>
    Peripheral standards eg DVI and HDMI and display port standard. DVI cables are generally just output video, HDMI are used if you need to hook up a monitor or projector for a slide presentation, and you want audio too. 
    Display port, which also outputs audio and video.
    </p>
    <p><h3>communication connectors</h3> <br>
        Different cable connectors are used to share information between devices and connect to the internet. IT professionals maintain network systems that use different types of communication connectors. <br>
        Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) refers to cables transmitting voice through twisted copper pair wires. Landline telephones, dial-up internet, and alarm systems use POTS. The RJ-11 (Register Jack 11) connector is used for POTS. <br>
        Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) provides access to high-speed networks or the internet through telephone lines and a modem. The RJ-45 connects a computer to network elements and is mostly used with ethernet cables. <br>
        Cable Internet uses a cable TV infrastructure and a modem to provide high-speed internet access to users. An F type connector is commonly used with cable modems. <br>
        Fiber-optic cables contain strands of glass fibers inside an insulated casing that send data long-distance and allow for higher-bandwidth communication. The major internet providers use fiber-optic cables for high-speed internet service. <br>
        
    </p>
    <p> A punch down block is a terminal strip used to connect telephone or data lines. Punch down blocks are a quick and easy way to connect wiring. IT professionals use punch down blocks to change a wire or make a new connection for a telephone system or Local Area Network (LAN). </p>

    </DIV>
    <div> 
        <p> Which characteristics differentiate a Solid State Drive (SSD) from a Hard Disk Drive (HDD)? Select all that apply.    
        Non-moving parts 
        Correct
        SSDs have non-moving parts, are less prone to damage, and utilize non-volatile memory.    
        Greater durability
        Correct
        SSDs have non-moving parts, are less prone to damage, and utilize non-volatile memory.</p>
    <p> Land Grid Array (LGA) and Pocket Grid Array (PGA) are two common types of CPU sockets.</p>
    </div>

    <div> 
        <p> our devices also use programs to tell the CPU how to run them. These programs are called services or drivers. 
            The drivers contain the instructions our CPU needs to understand external devices like keyboards, webcams, printers.
            Our CPU doesn't know that there is a device that it can talk to. It has to connect to something called the BIOS or basic input output services.
            The BIOS is software that helps initialize the hardware in our computer and gets our operating system up and running. <br> 
            Our motherboard stores the bios in a special type of memory called the read only memory chip or ROM chip. Unlike RAM, ROM is non-volatile, meaning it won't erase the data if the computer is turned off.
            Once the operating system loads, we're able to load drivers from non-essential devices directly from the hard drive <br> 
            Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. UEFI performs the same function of starting your computer as a traditional BIOS, but it's more modern and has better compatibility and support for new hardware. <br>
            When you turn on a computer, you might notice a beeping from time-to-time. Our computers run a test to make sure all the hardware is working correctly.
            This is called a power-on self-test or POST. The bios runs it when you boot up your computer. <br> 
            There's a special chip on our motherboard called the CMOS chip. It stores basic data about boosting your computer, like the date, time, and how you want it to start up. You can change these settings by booting into CMOS or BIOS settings menu. <br>
            
            Reimaging of a computer refers to a disk image, which is a copy of an operating system. The process of reimaging involves wiping and installing an operating system. This procedure is typically performed using a program that stored on some external device, like a USB memory stick or a CD ROM, or even a server accessible through the network. 
            To access these programs and perform the re-image, you will need to use the bios to tell the computer to boot up from that external device. <br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> After running a POST, the BIOS initializes the hardware and loads up essential drivers.
            The POST (Power On Self Test) figures out what hardware is on the computer and makes sure it is running properly before the BIOS initializes the hardware or loads up essential drivers.
            The BIOS settings are stored in the CMOS.
            A driver is a program that contains instructions the CPU needs to understand an external device. Most external devices have drivers.
